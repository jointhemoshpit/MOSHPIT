          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
			<p>We are MOSHPIT! A brand that shapes a community where rock fans from all around the world come together to share their fire and passion on stage. Featuring thrilling events hosted by MOSHPIT, community and event chats we are determined to be the beating hearts of the rock movement. So, raise your horns high, grasp the lightning, and join us in the MOSHPIT, where the rock revolution is in full swing! <br><br>
			With the following report a detailed description of the marketing campaign for MOSHPIT will be discussed. This will include four main themes like context of campaign and promotional activities, learning points, future planning, and professionalism. </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
			<h5>Campaign</h5>
          <p>The marketing campaign of MOSHPIT has the goal to brand awareness of a new product in a niche market. Furthermore, the aim is to generate community reach and engagement that we measure with the help of objectives that we set for the first four weeks of the campaign (can be found below). The message the campaign aimed to portray is: <em>“Put your horns up and get ready to create meaningful experiences and rock-solid connection by joining the MOSHPIT”.</em>  The promotional activities executed for the campaign were chosen based on channel/platform choices and in accordance with the target audience preferences. It all circled back to original content creation. Original color palettes, logos and visuals were crafted and helped to make the brand resonate with the target audience and keep the consistency between posts. Following that, official posters, informational and entertainment videos/posts were made and shared through the social media chosen. This is also discussed below and can be found in the <a href="https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/220711_buas_nl/ER3NKvkZ8kZGnGY2PZq92SUBWvONsvhpX8ZfQzRB9ySDPg?e=9boMBj"> Communication and Media Plan</a> made specifically for the campaign.  </p>
			<h5> Objectives</h5>
          <p>The marketing objectives set for the campaign of MOSHPIT are as follows: <br>

             <ul><em>Reach objective:</em> By 1st of April 2024 the following objectives should be reached:  
<li> Instagram: 200 account interactions from the different content posted (reels, posts, stories).   </li> 
<li>TikTok: 100 accounts interactions of the content (TikToks) posted. </li>  </ul>
<ul> <em>Affect objective: </em> A sense of community for hard rock fans. </ul> 

<ul><em>Response objective:</em> By 1st of April 2024 the following objectives should be reached: 

<li>Instagram: 100 followers. Average daily engagement rate after 30 days is expected to be 2,5%. An engagement rate by post will be done on the last post posted for the month and expectations are to be 5%.  </li> 

<li>TikTok: 50 followers. Average daily engagement rate after 30 days is expected to be 2,5%. An engagement rate by post will be done on the last post posted for the month and expectations are to be 5%.  </li>

	<li>Website: 50 clicks should be generated. </li></ul> </p>

<p>Keeping in mind that we will only measure the results from 4 weeks, we decided not to be too ambitious and set small and easily achievable objectives that can give us an overview of how close we got to the set goal for the campaign. Furthermore, we used exact numbers and specific context in which they will be measured. </p>
		  <h5>Channels/Platforms</h5>
		  <p>The platforms chosen to carry out the campaign were Instagram and TikTok. With these platforms being in the top 5 biggest platforms in the world (Biggest Social Media Platforms 2024 | Statista, 2024), Instagram’s wise range of tools that make content pop out and TikTok’s unique algorithm, MOSHPIT’s marketing campaign found its’ home. We chose that based on our target audience, research, and a survey that we held.  </p>
		  <p>First, our target audience is young people between the age of 18 and 25 years old. They are part of Gen Z and have passion for (hard) rock. Gender and ethnicity do not matter; however, they live in the Netherlands (regardless Dutch or international). Research made showed that the top 3 social media platforms used by Gen Z are YouTube, Instagram and TikTok (Thomas, 2024). Over 80% of them discover new products on social media and they use on average 5 medial platforms daily (Gitnux, 2023). They mostly use social media for 4 hours a day (Shriber, 2024).  </p>
		  <p>Second, we carried out a survey so we can get a deeper insight into our target group and their social media behavior. The key insight from it were:  

<li>Most used social media platforms are Instagram and TikTok (91% and 73% votes). </li>

<li>Peaks of activity on these platforms are in the evenings (between 6 and 10 pm) and in the nights (between 10 pm and 4 am).  </li>

<li>Main purpose of the social medias is entertainment and social activities.   </li>

<li>Most consumed content are videos, pictures, and stories (Instagram).  </li> </p>
		  <p>These are the main insights that helped us make definite decisions about the social media platforms we will use and the basis on which the communication marketing plan was made. All the results from the survey can be found in the <em style="color: red">appendix</em>. 
<br>
With all this in mind, the platforms chosen had all its required to help us carry out a successful marketing campaign.   </p>

          <p>By week two we noticed that there is more traffic on both the platforms. On Instagram the connection between the reach and interactions was almost the same (we managed to engage the audience we reached). On TikTok even though our content was viewed a lot of times the interactions were a bit low. Nevertheless, only by week 2 the Reach objective on both the platforms was almost reached.     </p>

However, by week 3 the reach objective for Instagram was reached! The content interaction from Instagram were 229 (needed 200). The TikTok reach objective still needed a bit of time but was getting there.      </p>

          <p>In the final week, week 4, for the campaign one of the highest numbers for the TikTok account were reached. And with that the reach objective for the TikTok account was also covered! However, in the end the response objective was not met. The Instagram account only generated 65 (out of 100) followers and the TikTok only 12 out of the desired 50.  

  </p>
		  <p>All in all, the social media accounts performed well but failed to meet some of the objectives. While the reach objective of both accounts was met, we couldn’t manage to get people to follow the accounts, especially the one on TikTok. As for the affect objective, we do not consider it a failed one since a community takes time to build but from the first 4 weeks of the campaign the base for such a community is set.  </p>
		  <p>Last but not least, the response objective regarding the clicks generated on the website was reached successfully. The promotions for it were done on both social media accounts so it can get as much exposure as possible. Even on the first day we already had 6 clicks but by the end they turned into 64 (desired 50).  </p>
		  <h5>Takebacks</h5>
		  <p>The things learned from this campaign are a lot. From small things like the fact that a content creator shouldn’t forget to make the TikTok profile a business one so they can have statistics to how a campaign is actually supposed to work. During the campaign we learned that Gen Z is a very vulnerable target audience and social media consumers. They have a very short attention span, and it is harder than it looks to create content that they will want to interact with. Some posts were made without a lot of thought to be put and just to keep the aesthetics of the feed, when later on we realized that just posting a solid color as a post can have several meanings that can lead customers to confusion. Moreover, the trends are changing non-stop, and a content creator should really be fully dedicated to following them at all times. Furthermore, very deep and good research on how the algorithms of the platforms is required for the most output. We didn’t expect that it would be that hard to generate followers, especially on TikTok. For such a big platform 50 followers seemed so little and still we managed to get only 10% of them. Also, we expected that the reels on Instagram will do better than they did in terms of attracting users to the main page.A decision that the team made was to split some of the posts in Instagram into multiple once. While we did that so we can create a stronger visual impact (Andrew, 2019), we realized that it might have had a negative influence on the statistics since people also see it as something confusing and just ignore it (Basler, 2023). What did make an impression was that with time the hashtags got better at reaching the right audience and they really did contribute to push our content to as many accounts out there as possible. The content calendar didn’t change much since we based all the decisions for it on the results from surveys and research mentioned above and the team stuck close to it.  </p>
		  <p>Overall, the team expected to have better results. However, a general learning point is that we might have underestimated the target audience since we are also part of it, and we take that if we like something they will also like it. Things that we would do differently in the future is to post more on both social medias, make more content like pools and voting to actually engage with the target audience and prepare the visuals better.  </p>
		  
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>If the project was to continue some changes should be applied. Target audience doesn’t require any changes, however more research should be done in terms of their online behavior and more ways to engage with them should be looked into. Moreover, the communication and media calendar needs to be enriched. In the first 4 weeks an average of 10 posts per week was made. Out of this maximum 3 were on TikTok, which can be seen as something to be improved. The social media themselves recommend 3 posts a day (Macready, 2023), which the team couldn’t do but certainly can improve for the future. On Instagram on the other hand content containing giveaways and prizes (concert tickets or free drinks) should be made. This will increase the interest in the product and make people want to interact (Carter, 2024). Also, as mentioned above a recommendation is to not split the posts on Instagram so often unless it’s necessary. Furthermore, to be able to see how these changes are going to affect the campaigns, new objectives for the brand should be set. Based on past experience and taking into consideration the changes that will be implemented to the social media tactics we recommend objectives as follows:  </p>
		  <p><ul><em>Reach objective:</em> By 31st December 2024 the following objectives should be reached:  
<li>Instagram: 2000 account interactions from the different content posted (reels, posts, stories). </li> <li>TikTok: 1500 accounts interactions of the content (TikToks) posted.</li>   
		  </ul><ul><em>Affect objective:</em> A sense of community for hard rock fans.   </ul> 

<ul><em>Response objective:</em> By 31st December 2024 the following objectives should be reached:   

<li>Instagram: 300 followers. Average daily engagement rate after 30 days is expected to be 2,5%. An engagement rate by post will be done on the last post posted for the month and expectations are to be 5%.   </li>

<li>TikTok: 400 followers. Average daily engagement rate after 30 days is expected to be 2,5%. An engagement rate by post will be done on the last post posted for the month and expectations are to be 5%.  </li>

<li>Website: 200 clicks should be generated.  
</li>
		  </ul>
		  
		  </p>
        <p>We wouldn’t recommend changing the affect objective since it is the core of the brand, and it is highly important for it to be reached in an effective way. Furthermore, if any of the objectives are reached before the deadline setting new ones with the situation in mind is good since what we put now as objectives is influenced by the numbers from the first 4 weeks.  </p>
		<p>A new communication and media plan has been crafted as an example of how frequent we would make the posts on both social medias, and it can be used as a template for the months left till the end of the second run of the campaign. <a href=.> Put link here.</a> </p>
		  
		  
          <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
          <p>We tried to stick as strictly as possible to the brand image that we crafted. However, it can be seen (mainly on the Instagram page) that the consistency of the post was a bit off. This is all because the defining of all the needed parts of the image such as colors and fonts were still not disclosed by the team. Therefore, a small difference between the post design from week 1 and the rest of the weeks can be noticed. However, the important thing is that MOSHPIT was designed as soon as possible, and we still managed to correct our mistake from the beginning and got on the right track afterwards!  </p>

		<p>As mentioned, before we decided to make split posts on Instagram thinking it was to our benefit to do so. Therefore, one justification of a post is sometimes applicable to more of it.
