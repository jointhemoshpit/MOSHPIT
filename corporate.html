			 <h4 id="content-1" class="mt-2">Brand Vision</h4>
		  <p>At MOSHPIT, we're not just about the music—we're about creating connections so strong they might upend the planet. We picture a badass community where rock enthusiasts from around the world assemble to erupt on stage with enthusiasm and passion.  We are the beating heart of a movement, where every headbang is a tribute to the strength of solidarity. We are not just fans. The stage is our temple, and the riff is our language in this thrilling sanctuary. Raise your horns, seize the lightning, and come party with us in the MOSHPIT, where the rock revolution is raging!  </p>
			<h4 id="content-2" class="mt-2">Brand Name</h4>
		  <p>We went deep into the heart of the rock community in our attempt to establish a platform that reflects the actual spirit of rock culture and encourages real connections among fans. One word kept coming up in our problem interviews and while doing in-depth research: "moshpit." For many outsiders, the moshpit may evoke images of chaos, violence, and danger—misconceptions often associated with heavy metal and rock music. But in the music scene, the moshpit is considered something much deeper. It is a place of purity, a haven for individual expression, and a representation of unity. Though it may not seem like it, the moshpit is a safe sanctuary where people gather to let loose, experience the music in their veins, and create relationships that cut over barriers. The word "moshpit" kept coming up in our problem interviews, highlighting its importance in the rock world. It became clear that this term captures the essence of what we want to represent: passion, unity, and the raw spirit of rock 'n' roll. By selecting "MOSHPIT" as our brand name, we honor this lasting element of the rock genre. We celebrate its actual essence—a place where listeners can be authentic and feel a strong connection to the music—and accept its duality, eliminating myths about it. </p>

				Colour Palette
             <p>Following the Problem Interviews, which helped us define our brand better, we have created a color palette based on what colours the target audience thought represent the hard rock community the best in the interviews. Therefore, our colour palette is the following:  </p>
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #202020;"></span>
                  #202020
                  <em>The colour black was the most mentioned in our Problem Interviews as a representative colour for rock music. However, we chose not to use pure black, but rather a shade of black that keeps the design bold but it’s easier for the eye and more readable.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #C3252F;"></span>
                  #C3252F
                  <em>Red was the second most mentioned colour by our target audience and it represents energy, passion and excitement, which also matches with how people described the rock community and what we want to associate our brand with.</em>
                </li>
				     <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #272C7E;"></span>
                  #272C7E
                  <em>Blue signifies trust and dependability, values that we want people to feel through our product, and we chose a shade of dark blue as it creates a bold design. </em>
                </li>
				    <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FDD838;"></span>
                  #FDD838
                  <em>Yellow represents joy and promotes fun, which is also what we want to make people feel through our events. Moreover, it is another one of the mentioned colours by our target audience and we used it to create a bold contrast with the red and blue shades.</em>
                </li>
				    <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="border-color: black; background-color: #717276;"></span>
                  #717276:
                  <em>As we already had 3 bold colors, we chose to also have grey as another neutral color in order to create a balance to the overall visual composition of the website.</em>
                </li> 
				 <p>References for the color justification can be found in <a href="#references">Appendix References</a>. </p>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Font choices</li>
			  <p>For our website, we chose only two fonts to keep the website consistent and cohesive: <span class="headlinefont">DeLittle Chromatic </span>for the headlines, and <span class="textfont">Rockwell </span> for other text.  </p>

<p>We have created the logo ourselves, for which we used sharp lines and edges for each letter in order to create a bold design. The font DeLittle Chromatic matched a lot with the style of our logo, which is why we chose it to keep the website cohesive with the brand’s identity. Moreover, the bold design of the font creates a strong impression and captures the reader’s attention. </p>

<p>However, to create a balance and not overwhelm the user, we chose a simpler, easier for the eye font for the rest of the text.  While not as sharp as DeLittle Chromatic, the Rockwell font has a subtle angularity by keeping a balance between sharp and rounded elements, adding a touch of dynamism to the text. </p> </ul>
		  <li>Logo</li>
		  <p>For our logo we created two versions: a main logo with the full name of the brand and a secondary logo that has a different layout in order to be adaptable to various formats. <br> Our main logo was created by drawing each letter with sharp lines and edges in order to make them look bold and unique. Moreover, instead of aligning the letters in a straight line, we put them in a wavy pattern to represent the crowd movements at a concert, where people create a wave-like effect when raising their hands. <br> For our second logo, in order to make it smaller and adaptable to formats like social media profiles, we decided to use only the M from our main logo and actually create an illustration of people's hands raised at a concert. We decided to use our two main colors (black and red) as they were the ones most associated with the rock commmunity in our problem interviews.</p>
		  <li>Supporting visuals</li>
		  Our supporting visuals include pictures of crowds and venues, as our service is about rock events. We searched specifically for pictures that are bold and represent the good energy we want at our own events. However, we would use actual pictures from our own events once our first ones happen. Moreover, for the meet the team pictures found <a href="moshpit-team.html">here</a> we decided to use black and white in order to create a striking visual contrast and puts focus on each person, while also keeping the consistency of our brand's colors with colorful cards and text. We also chose to display a picture of the team together to be a visual representation of cooperation and trust, as it represents the values we have within our events and community.  Moreover, it makes our brand more approachable and relatable as it makes it easier for people to connect with us when they see the faces behind it not only separately, but also united. For the team picture, we chose to give it red and blue tones rather than black and white as it makes the picture feel bold, fun and consistent with our color palette. Giving the team picture a different color from the individual pictures is also meant to empathize the individual value of each member.

				MOSHPIT Colour Scheme
             <p>While designing the website, we kept our brand style and identity in mind. Following the Problem Interviews, which helped us define our brand better, we have created a color palette based on what colours the target audience thought represent the hard rock community the best in the interviews.  Moreover, based on the problem interviews we found that a part of the target audience would prefer a bold design, while another part would prefer a vintage design.  This led us to creating an online poll that had people choose between a bold design and a vintage design, which resulted in 53% of the target audience preferring a bold style for a rock website, which also had an impact on our colour scheme and design choices. Therefore, our colour palette is the following:  </p>
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #202020;"></span>

			  <p>For our website, we chose only two fonts to keep the website consistent and cohesive: <span class="headlinefont">DeLittle Chromatic </span>for the headlines, and <span class="textfont">Rockwell </span> for other text.  </p>

<p>We have created the logo ourselves, for which we used sharp lines and edges for each letter in order to create a bold design. The font DeLittle Chromatic matched a lot with the style of our logo, which is why we chose it to keep the website cohesive with the brand’s identity. Moreover, the bold design of the font creates a strong impression and captures the reader’s attention. </p>

<p>However, to create a balance and not overwhelm the user, we chose a simpler, easier for the eye font for the rest of the text.  While not as sharp as DeLittle Chromatic, the Rockwell font has a subtle angularity by keeping a balance between sharp and rounded elements, adding a touch of dynamism to the text. </p>
            <li>User interface patterns</li>
			  <h6><em>Homepage</em></h6>
			  <ul> 
			  <li> Homepage Video<br> <p> In order to catch the attention of the visitors of our website the first thing they will see is a video of a crowd with a call to action and our logo. With this we set the mood of our brand and catch their attention within the first second the visitor enters the website. </p></li>
			   <li> Event Carousel<br> <p> Since our product is events we want to show the visitor as many events as possible. However if all the events are put in one place on one page it can be seen as overwhelming. Therefore we used a carousel, with this the visitor can click to see more events and doesn’t get overwhelmed by the amount of events.  </p></li>
			    <li> Chats Cards<br> <p> In order to give information in an eye-catching way we decided to put our information on a card. This way the text clearly stands out and will be read. We also added a button with a call to action for people to click on. This button will lead them directly to the chatroom page and there they can find even more information.    </p></li>
			   <li> Value Cards<br> <p> Once again we wanted to make sure our information was placed on the website in an eye-catching way. By putting our information in the format of a card the text will stand out and catch their attention. however to not scare away the visitors with a large amount of text we decided to add a read more button. This way the step to start reading it is smaller and easier.     </p></li>
			 <li> Photo with Call to Action<br> <p> To encourage people to take action and join the MOSHPIT we added a call to action at the end of the page so they once again get reminded to make an account and join.      </p></li>
				  
			  </ul>
			  <h6><em>Event Calendar Page</em></h6>
			  <p>In order to organize a page with a lot of information we decided to keep it simple and clean. This is why we have simple boxes with the same format of titles and a small bit of information, and a clear button where you can find more information about the event you are interested in. Because of the pop up screen when you click on your chosen event  you don’t get unnecessary information about events you are not interested in, this prevents an information overload. By putting all the boxes symmetrical it gives a calm look while giving you just the information that you need. This all together creates a clear page where our product is shown and easily understood by the visitors.  </p>
			  <h6><em>Chat Rooms Page</em></h6>
			  <p>The design of the Chat Rooms page is based on a template inspired by Discord. We selected this structure for the Chatroom page mostly because of the familiarity people have with it already, as it shares common patterns with several well-known chat websites and applications. The main components of the chatroom represent the chat side panel, where all the channels and friends of the users appear, and the actual chatbox, where people can talk with others. However, on a smaller screen the side bar disappears in order to make the chat the full screen, but users can access it by clicking on a “+” icon that is located on a sidebar which also displays users’ account.  
				  
 We chose to have a white background for the chatbox because it is a familiar and intuitive design pattern for many chat applications as it provides high contrast to the text and makes messages easier to read.  </p>
			  
			  
				  
			<h6><em>Meet The Team Page</em></h6>	  
			  <p>We chose to keep the Meet the Team page simple and straight to the point as it might encourage people to interact with the information about the team more, as this might seem less important to some users and they might not interact with it if too much information is displayed. We chose to firstly display a picture of the team together to be a visual representation of cooperation and trust, as it represents the values we have within our events and community.  Moreover, it makes our brand more approachable and relatable as it makes it easier for people to connect with us when they see the faces behind it not only separately, but also united. We have used our headline font in yellow for the ‘Meet the team behind MOSHPIT’ and for the names of the members, as it grabs the attention and focuses it on the team, engaging people to check it out. Moreover, we chose to display a small description of each member by hovering over their photo, as it might engage the users more and actually make them curious to read what shows up, rather than just adding it under each member card. Moreover, this way the description becomes the focus instead of the yellow bold font, making it a balance between showcasing a bold design without taking away from the smaller details.   </p>
				  

			  
            <li>The structure of the navigation and content</li>
			  <p> 

<ul> In order to keep the navigation simple and clear for the user, we have distributed the content over 4 pages: 
<li>Homepage </li> <li>Event Page  </li>
<li>Chat Rooms  </li>
<li>About Us (More specifically, Meet the Team page, as Corporate is also part of this but it wouldn’t be available for the actual user) </li>
</ul>
We display an overview of all the most important content on the home page since it is the first one that users see. In order to grab users’ attention, the first thing they see on it is a video that includes a call to action.  As they scroll down, the next thing they see is the most important thing we offer, our events, followed by our second feature which is our chats.  Additionally, customers are able to see our values next, in order to connect them to our brand, followed by another call to action reminding them to join us. The other pages are focused on what they represent: 
<ul> <li>On the Event Page customers can see all of the upcoming MOSHPIT events and can purchase tickets </li>
		<li>On the Chat Rooms Page they can join different channels and chat with people </li>	  
	<li>On the Meet The Team Page they can see the faces behind our brand and read a small description about them, in order to make them feel more connected to us. </li>
		    </ul>

 </p>
 
                <li>How does website design fit the values and personality of the brand?</li>
				  <p>Firstly, the values and personality of the brand, as well as the design and production choices, have been made based on the insights from the target audience. Therefore, our color palette represents feelings of passion, trust, joy and fun which are directly related to our values of ‘Rock Solid Trust’ and ‘Dive into meaningful experiences’. Moreover, we showcase our brand values and personality by using a conversational and informal tone of voice that incorporates rock slang throughout the whole website. Our bold imagery and logo design are also a direct reflection of our brand’s identity. </p>
				  
                <li>How does website design fit the marketing and communication strategy?</li>
			<p>In order for the website design to fit the marketing and communication strategy we mainly focused on consistency. We kept all the colors, fonts, and imagery the same style. This way when customers switch from our socials to our website or the other way around they can clearly see it is the same brand.</p>
                <li>How does website design help showcase the unique value proposal of the product?</li>
			<p>Since our unique value proposal are our products we create a clear emphasis on the products at our website. By having our products in the navigation bar already we showcase our features and what we offer from the first look customers have at our website. Besides this the whole homepage also showcases our products one by one and gives detailed information about them. By showcasing our products as clear and as often as possible on our website we create a clear overview of what we offer and what customers can expect.

          <h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2">Testing Report</h4>
		  <h5>Testing Round</h5>
          <p>In order to see whether our website if fully functional and whether there are things that need to be improved, we are conducting a testing round with 4 participants within our target group. The participants are 3 females and 1 male, they are between 20 and 24 years old. Lastly one thing all participants have in common is that they are part of the hard rock community. These people are yet unknown to our product and will therefore have an uninformed position. To properly test the functions of our website we gave our participants the following tasks to do on within our website on a computer. We will record with our phone to be able to look back on the testing and be able to draw more conclusions. </p>
		  <p> <ul> Tasks for the participants to do: 
		  <li>Go to the event calendar page </li>
		  <li>Go to the meet the team page  </li>
		   <li>Go to the chats page </li>
		  <li>Go back to the homepage </li>
		   <li>Send a message in an event chat  </li>
		  <li>Add a friend/ group chat </li>
		   <li>Find information about Vladislava  </li>
		  <li>Find information about the MOSHPIT event in Utrecht and buy a ticket </li>
		   <li>Go the 4 brand values and read the full text </li>
		  <li>Find contact information about the brand and go to our Instagram page </li>
		  </ul></p>
		<p> If any struggle or confusion is seen at the participant, the interviewee will ask what the problem is and what in their opinion could be a solution. </p>
         <p>By giving the participants these tasks, we can fully test the functions of our website and if they work the way they should and if our target audience think it is logical how the website works.  </p>
		<p>When the participant finished the tasks, we will ask some follow up questions to get their opinion on the product and the features of it. The questions we will ask will be as followed.  </p>
		<p> <ul> Questions:
		<li>What did you think of the functionality of the website? </li>
		<li>Do you think it demonstrates the products, we as a brand offer well? </li>
		<li>Do you think any improvements can be made? </li>
		</ul></p>
	  <p>Video of the testing can be found in <a href="#appendixproduction">Appendix Production</a>.</p>	
	  <h5>Findings</h5>
	  <p><ul>By observing the participant navigation through our website, we concluded the following problems with our website: 
	  <li>While searching for the brand values participants went to the about us dropdown menu and couldn’t find the values there. Afterwards they were confused where to find the values and even looked over them. </li>
	  <li>While searching for the brand contact information some participants went to the about us tab in order to find the contact information. After they saw it wasn’t there their first instinct was to go the bottom of the page and could find our contact information. However, it was not their first thought to search there. </li></ul></p>
	<p>After giving the participants tasks, we asked them the follow-up questions. The results from the questions where as followed. The participants thought the website was highly functionable with smooth functions. The website clearly shows the products we offer as a brand well along with the information about it. Lastly, things are easy to find. However, participants didn’t like that that there is no symbol to click on so you can send a message. Besides they think there should be separate pages for finding our contact information and for the brand values. Lastly, they think that adding a paragraph with information about the brand MOSHPIT would be beneficial. </p>
	<p>To conclude the positive and negative findings of the testing round the following points can be found below in order of importance: 
	<ul>Positive findings:
	<li>The products we offer as a brand are clear along with the information about our products </li>
		<li>The website is highly functionable, and information is easy to find </li>
		<li>The functions (buttons, navigation bars etc.) the website offers are very smooth </li>	
	</ul>
	<ul>Negative Findings:
	<li>The values and contact information of the brand are hard to find which makes users confused </li>
		<li>On the chatroom page there is no button to click on in order to send your message </li>
		<li>Information given about the brand MOSHPIT is seen as essential by participants </li>
	</ul>
	</p>
<p> 

Now that we have collected the findings, we can draw some conclusions on what we can improve on our website, in order to make it more user friendly. </p>
<h5>Improvement Suggestions</h5>
<p>From both our observations and follow up questions we can improve the following aspects of our website. A button to send the messages should be added to the chatroom page. Besides this we should add to the “About Us” dropdown menu two extra pages. One that is called “About MOSHPIT” and another called “Contact”. In the “About MOSHPIT” page we can give information about the brand like the values mission and vision and the requested paragraph about the brand MOSHPIT. In the “Contact” page we present all our contact information. This way if the users of our website are searching for information about the brand and our contact information, they should be faster in finding it, and there will be less confusion with this improved version.  </p>
<p> <ul>  

To sum this up the following things should be changed within the website to make it more user-friendly: 


<li> Within the dropdown menu “About Us” we need to add two extra pages that are “Contact” and “About MOSHPIT” </li>
<li>Add a send button to the chatroom page  </li>
<li>Add a paragraph with information about the brand MOSHPIT to our website </li></ul></p>
<p> 

With these improvements we will continue to improve our website. After improving,  we will  do another round of testing to see whether there is more confusing situations or things to improve.  </p>

<p>Reference List can be found in <a href="#references">Appendix References</a></p>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
			<h5>Campaign</h5>
          <p>The marketing campaign of MOSHPIT has the goal to brand awareness of a new product in a niche market. Furthermore, the aim is to generate community reach and engagement that we measure with the help of objectives that we set for the first four weeks of the campaign (can be found below). The message the campaign aimed to portray is: <em>“Put your horns up and get ready to create meaningful experiences and rock-solid connection by joining the MOSHPIT”.</em>  The promotional activities executed for the campaign were chosen based on channel/platform choices and in accordance with the target audience preferences. It all circled back to original content creation. Original color palettes, logos and visuals were crafted and helped to make the brand resonate with the target audience and keep the consistency between posts. Following that, official posters, informational and entertainment videos/posts were made and shared through the social media chosen. This is also discussed below and can be found in the <a href="https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/220711_buas_nl/ER3NKvkZ8kZGnGY2PZq92SUBWvONsvhpX8ZfQzRB9ySDPg?e=9boMBj"> Communication and Media Plan</a> made specifically for the campaign. The Communication and Media Plan can also be found in <a href="#appendixmarketing">Appendix Marketing</a>. </p>
			<h5> Objectives</h5>
          <p>The marketing objectives set for the campaign of MOSHPIT are as follows: <br>

  <ul><em>Reach objective:</em> By 1st of April 2024 the following objectives should be reached:  
<li> Instagram: 200 account interactions from the different content posted (reels, posts, stories).   </li> 
<li>TikTok: 100 accounts interactions of the content (TikToks) posted. </li>  </ul>
<ul> <em>Affect objective: </em> A sense of community for hard rock fans. </ul> 

<ul><em>Response objective:</em> By 1st of April 2024 the following objectives should be reached: 

<li>Instagram: 100 followers. Average daily engagement rate after 30 days is expected to be 2,5%. An engagement rate by post will be done on the last post posted for the month and expectations are to be 5%.  </li> 

<li>TikTok: 50 followers. Average daily engagement rate after 30 days is expected to be 2,5%. An engagement rate by post will be done on the last post posted for the month and expectations are to be 5%.  </li>

	<li>Website: 50 clicks should be generated. </li></ul> </p>

<p>Keeping in mind that we will only measure the results from 4 weeks, we decided not to be too ambitious and set small and easily achievable objectives that can give us an overview of how close we got to the set goal for the campaign. Furthermore, we used exact numbers and specific context in which they will be measured. </p>
		  <h5>Channels/Platforms</h5>
		  <p>The platforms chosen to carry out the campaign were Instagram and TikTok. With these platforms being in the top 5 biggest platforms in the world (Biggest Social Media Platforms 2024 | Statista, 2024), Instagram’s wise range of tools that make content pop out and TikTok’s unique algorithm, MOSHPIT’s marketing campaign found its’ home. We chose that based on our target audience, research, and a survey that we held.  </p>
		  <p>First, our target audience is young people between the age of 18 and 25 years old. They are part of Gen Z and have passion for (hard) rock. Gender and ethnicity do not matter; however, they live in the Netherlands (regardless Dutch or international). Research made showed that the top 3 social media platforms used by Gen Z are YouTube, Instagram and TikTok (Thomas, 2024). Over 80% of them discover new products on social media and they use on average 5 medial platforms daily (Gitnux, 2023). They mostly use social media for 4 hours a day (Shriber, 2024).  </p>
		  <p>Second, we carried out a survey so we can get a deeper insight into our target group and their social media behavior. The key insight from it were:  

<li>Most used social media platforms are Instagram and TikTok (91% and 73% votes). </li>

<li>Peaks of activity on these platforms are in the evenings (between 6 and 10 pm) and in the nights (between 10 pm and 4 am).  </li>

<li>Main purpose of the social medias is entertainment and social activities.   </li>

<li>Most consumed content are videos, pictures, and stories (Instagram).  </li> </p>
		  <p>These are the main insights that helped us make definite decisions about the social media platforms we will use and the basis on which the communication marketing plan was made. All the results from the survey can be found in the <a href="#appendixmarketing">Appendix Marketing</a>. 
<br>
With all this in mind, the platforms chosen had all its required to help us carry out a successful marketing campaign.   </p>

          <p>By week two we noticed that there is more traffic on both the platforms. On Instagram the connection between the reach and interactions was almost the same (we managed to engage the audience we reached). On TikTok even though our content was viewed a lot of times the interactions were a bit low. Nevertheless, only by week 2 the Reach objective on both the platforms was almost reached.     </p>

However, by week 3 the reach objective for Instagram was reached! The content interaction from Instagram were 229 (needed 200). The TikTok reach objective still needed a bit of time but was getting there.      </p>

          <p>In the final week, week 4, for the campaign one of the highest numbers for the TikTok account were reached. And with that the reach objective for the TikTok account was also covered! However, in the end the response objective was not met. The Instagram account only generated 65 (out of 100) followers and the TikTok only 12 out of the desired 50.  

  </p>
		  <p>All in all, the social media accounts performed well but failed to meet some of the objectives. While the reach objective of both accounts was met, we couldn’t manage to get people to follow the accounts, especially the one on TikTok. As for the affect objective, we do not consider it a failed one since a community takes time to build but from the first 4 weeks of the campaign the base for such a community is set.  </p>
		  <p>Last but not least, the response objective regarding the clicks generated on the website was reached successfully. The promotions for it were done on both social media accounts so it can get as much exposure as possible. Even on the first day we already had 6 clicks but by the end they turned into 64 (desired 50).  </p>
		  <h5>Takebacks</h5>
		  <p>The things learned from this campaign are a lot. From small things like the fact that a content creator shouldn’t forget to make the TikTok profile a business one so they can have statistics to how a campaign is actually supposed to work. During the campaign we learned that Gen Z is a very vulnerable target audience and social media consumers. They have a very short attention span, and it is harder than it looks to create content that they will want to interact with. Some posts were made without a lot of thought to be put and just to keep the aesthetics of the feed, when later on we realized that just posting a solid color as a post can have several meanings that can lead customers to confusion. Moreover, the trends are changing non-stop, and a content creator should really be fully dedicated to following them at all times. Furthermore, very deep and good research on how the algorithms of the platforms is required for the most output. We didn’t expect that it would be that hard to generate followers, especially on TikTok. For such a big platform 50 followers seemed so little and still we managed to get only 10% of them. Also, we expected that the reels on Instagram will do better than they did in terms of attracting users to the main page.A decision that the team made was to split some of the posts in Instagram into multiple once. While we did that so we can create a stronger visual impact (Andrew, 2019), we realized that it might have had a negative influence on the statistics since people also see it as something confusing and just ignore it (Basler, 2023). What did make an impression was that with time the hashtags got better at reaching the right audience and they really did contribute to push our content to as many accounts out there as possible. The content calendar didn’t change much since we based all the decisions for it on the results from surveys and research mentioned above and the team stuck close to it.  </p>
		  <p>Overall, the team expected to have better results. However, a general learning point is that we might have underestimated the target audience since we are also part of it, and we take that if we like something they will also like it. Things that we would do differently in the future is to post more on both social medias, make more content like pools and voting to actually engage with the target audience and prepare the visuals better.  </p>
		  
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>If the project was to continue some changes should be applied. Target audience doesn’t require any changes, however more research should be done in terms of their online behavior and more ways to engage with them should be looked into. Moreover, the communication and media calendar needs to be enriched. In the first 4 weeks an average of 10 posts per week was made. Out of this maximum 3 were on TikTok, which can be seen as something to be improved. The social media themselves recommend 3 posts a day (Macready, 2023), which the team couldn’t do but certainly can improve for the future. On Instagram on the other hand content containing giveaways and prizes (concert tickets or free drinks) should be made. This will increase the interest in the product and make people want to interact (Carter, 2024). Also, as mentioned above a recommendation is to not split the posts on Instagram so often unless it’s necessary. Furthermore, to be able to see how these changes are going to affect the campaigns, new objectives for the brand should be set. Based on past experience and taking into consideration the changes that will be implemented to the social media tactics we recommend objectives as follows:  </p>
		  <p><ul><em>Reach objective:</em> By 31st December 2024 the following objectives should be reached:  
<li>Instagram: 2000 account interactions from the different content posted (reels, posts, stories). </li> <li>TikTok: 1500 accounts interactions of the content (TikToks) posted.</li>   
		  </ul><ul><em>Affect objective:</em> A sense of community for hard rock fans.   </ul> 

<ul><em>Response objective:</em> By 31st December 2024 the following objectives should be reached:   

<li>Instagram: 300 followers. Average daily engagement rate after 30 days is expected to be 2,5%. An engagement rate by post will be done on the last post posted for the month and expectations are to be 5%.   </li>

<li>TikTok: 400 followers. Average daily engagement rate after 30 days is expected to be 2,5%. An engagement rate by post will be done on the last post posted for the month and expectations are to be 5%.  </li>

<li>Website: 200 clicks should be generated.  
</li>
  </ul>
		  
		  </p>
        <p>We wouldn’t recommend changing the affect objective since it is the core of the brand, and it is highly important for it to be reached in an effective way. Furthermore, if any of the objectives are reached before the deadline setting new ones with the situation in mind is good since what we put now as objectives is influenced by the numbers from the first 4 weeks.  </p>
		<p>A new communication and media plan has been crafted as an example of how frequent we would make the posts on both social medias, and it can be used as a template for the months left until the end of the second run of the campaign. The new Communication and Media Plan for Future Planning can be found in <a href="#appendixmarketing"> Appendix Marketing</a>. </p>
		  
		  
          <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
          <p>We tried to stick as strictly as possible to the brand image that we crafted. However, it can be seen (mainly on the Instagram page) that the consistency of the post was a bit off. This is all because the defining of all the needed parts of the image such as colors and fonts were still not disclosed by the team. Therefore, a small difference between the post design from week 1 and the rest of the weeks can be noticed. However, the important thing is that MOSHPIT was designed as soon as possible, and we still managed to correct our mistake from the beginning and got on the right track afterwards!  </p>

<p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Although rock fans are in the community, it's a struggle for them to find company for a concert or an event.</em> 
			  <p>Social Connection Difficulty: After conducting in-depth problem interviews with rock fans, we discovered a common problem in the community: even if other rock fans are all around them, many people find it difficult to find friends for events or performances. Because of their isolation, they are unable to give their passion their all and take full advantage of the lively rock environment. </p>
		    </li>
			  
            <li><em>It's a struggle for rock fans to find events easily and in a convenient way. </em>
		    <p>Event Discovery Challenge: Finding relevant events quickly and easily is a major obstacle that rock enthusiasts must overcome, according to our research. Due to the spread of event information over multiple platforms and sources, fans frequently lose out on opportunities to engage with the rock community, which leads to low engagement and a disconnected feeling. </p></li>
			  <li><em>Rock fans are often victims of stereotyping because of their appearence. </em>
			  <p>Stereotyping and prejudice: In addition, rock enthusiasts voiced their worries about encountering discrimination and stereotypes because of their looks and musical tastes. In addition to hurting their confidence, this unfavourable opinion builds social barriers that make it challenging for them to build meaningful relationships and feel accepted in the community. </p></li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Inform about rock events nearby organized and hosted by us.</em> 
			  <p>Comprehensive Event Information: We created a solution to solve the difficulty of event discovery by informing rock enthusiasts about local events that we organise and host, drawing on insights from our problem interviews. Our goal is to enable fans to fully immerse themselves in the dynamic rock scene by giving them quick access to comprehensive event information through the selection and organisation of event listings.  </p>
		    </li>
			  
            <li><em>A community chat and an event chat where rock fans can communicate with each other. </em>
			  <p>Community Engagement tools: We integrated community chat and event chat tools into our platform since we understand how important social connections are for rock fans. These interactive tools solve the social connection difficulties found during problem interviews by allowing users to connect with others who share their interests, exchange stories, and create lasting relationships within the rock community.  </p></li>
			  <li><em>The option to add friends which allows them to find company for an event or a concert. </em>
			  <p>Facilitated Companionship: We added the ability to add friends to our platform in response to the difficulty people have in finding companions for events and concerts. By facilitating communication between users and allowing them to plan events, this feature helps users get past social challenges that frequently prevent them from participating in the rock scene.  </p></li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>People involved in the Rock Scene:  </em><p>Our target audience is made up of passionate rock fans who are actively involved in the rock community. This guarantees that those who have a strong respect for rock music and culture will find our solution appealing. </p></li>
            <li><em>Between 18-25 years old (Gen Z) </em> <p> By focusing on this group of people, we may find technology and social media involved consumers who are more likely to interact with our platform and have similar tastes. This helps us make sure that our solution satisfies the needs and preferences of our main user base. Gen Zers jump between social media feeds, applications, and websites, each of which contributes differently to their online habitat. Because they grew up with social media, Gen Zers cultivate their online personas more carefully than previous generations did. Despite their ravenous online media consumption, they are more inclined to adopt trends like anonymity, more personalised feeds, and a smaller online presence (What Is Gen Z?, 2023). </p></li>
			  <li><em>Living in the Netherlands: </em> <p> By focusing on a particular area at first, we can build a solid reputation within the local rock community before spreading out to other areas. This helps to guarantee that our solution appeals to our target market's customers and satisfies their particular needs and preferences. </p></li>
			  <li><em>Brand Persona</em>
			  <p>Annabelle Jensen: Annabelle represents our ideal user persona, reflecting the characteristics and preferences of our target market. Her demographic profile matches that of our target audience, and as a 22-year-old female student studying business management in Utrecht, Netherlands, we can be sure that our solution will appeal to people similar to her and suit their unique requirements and preferences.</p>

				  <p>While before we were thinking of charging a fee on tickets that we sell on behalf of other organizers, now we have changed our position to being the one organizing the events.  After all, since our brand has the main feature of proposing events to customers it comes naturally that we can host our own events. This will make us an event management company but since we manage our own events all the profit from the ticket sales will come to us. To boost this revenue stream into giving higher and better results things we can do is make tickets in different categories such as early access, general admission etc. By making such division we not only propose a wider variety of options to our customers, but also have the round to sell some tickets on higher price. Furthermore, having add on product/services on the tickets as guaranteed parking spot or luggage storage is also a way to boost up the revenue.  </p></ul></li>
		        <li>Merchadise (re)selling</li>
			  <p>The merchandise revenue stream comes in as a second one since we will be reselling the products of the bands that we recruit for a performance. We will do that at the event itself and online on our website. The profit from it will come as we will charge for 40% profit on a sale. </p></ul>
		    </li> 
			  <h5>Revenue Streams Estimate (1st Year)</h5>
			  <ul>To calculate the Turnover expected at the end of the 1st operating year we assume that:  
			  <li>Moshpit will host approximately 5 events per month</li>
				  <li>Each event has a capacity of 300 people, and each show is sold out </li>
				  <li>90% of tickets are general admission (20 euros) and 10 are early access (25 euros)</li>
				  <li>Each month a total of 100 pieces of merchandise is sold each 15 euros with 40% of the profit per piece coming to us  </li>
			  </ul>

          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
          <ul>
			  <p>Main costs: venue cost, artists payment, renting AV equipment </p>
            <li>Fixed costs:
				<ul><li>Office Space</li> <li>Marketing costs</li>
				<p>As the business will have a lot more costs to cover, we will go through the most important ones. First, the fixed costs we will discuss will be the office space that our team will need to operate and the marketing costs we will need to pay. These costs are fixed because we will need to pay them regardless of how well our product sell is going. </p></ul>
		</li>
			<li>Variable Costs:
			  <ul> <li>Venue Rent</li><li>Artist's Payment</li>
				<p> Second, the variable costs we pay higher attention to are the venue rental and artists payment. As we are a small company, we will aim to strike deals with venue (bar) owners to help each other out and advertise each other. However, we know that sometimes a certain fee will be involved so we list that under costs. Artists’ payment is also another vital cost for us. As the cost of that depends on how big the band is, how long they will play on stage and sometimes the number of band members we expect it to differ from event to event. We list all these costs under the variable costs since it depends on how many events will be hosted per month/year. Sound system equipment rental/purchase is not listed since the venues/bars we will hold our events at have such equipment and we will count on using them.  </p>
			  </ul></li>  
           <h5>Cost Structure Estimated (1st year)  </h5>
			  <ul>To calculate this, we will consider what was assumed for the turnover and have the following things in mind:  
				  <li>Moshpit will host approximately 5 events per month</li>
				  <li>Office space is 125€ a month per person (4 people as many as the group is now) (Regius, n.d.) </li>
			    <li>Marketing costs will be 5.000€ a month (Elfimova, n.d.)</li>
				    <li>Venue/Bar rent will be counted as 500€ a night (Coco’s Outback | Rent Your Own Bar, n.d.) </li>
				    <li>Artist’s payment will be 200€ per gig (Terzi and Terzi, 2023) </li>

			<p>Having that said we can calculate the cost per unit. In our case a unit is equivalent to one event. We will calculate the cost per unit for the period of 1 year.   <br>

<em>Cost per Unit = 138.000/60 = 2.300€ (when one unit is equivalent to one concert/event). </em> <br>

<em>Cost per Unit = 138.000/18.000 = 7,67€ (when one unit is equivalent to one attendee).</em>  </p>

  <p class="fw-bold">Conclusion</p>
<p>Based on the information gathered from solution interviews, we made multiple pivots in our identification of problems, solutions, and other canvas elements during the course of our Lean Canvas phases.  We made many adjustments to our Lean Canvas approach based on information obtained from solution interviews, which helped us better grasp the issue and craft solutions. Significantly, these solution interviews identified an early adopter profile: passionate rock fans, in their 18–25 years of age, living in the Netherlands, and actively participating in the scene. The difficulty finding companions for rock events and concerts was a must-have concern for these individuals, who had a high connection with the observed problem. In order to address this, we focused on adding just the essential features that would address this essential issue: comprehensive event listings, community and event chat features, and the opportunity to interact with other rock lovers.  

Potential users gave us overwhelmingly good comments during our solution interviews. They acknowledged the problem statements we raised and showed support and enthusiasm for the solutions we suggested. Crucially, the price point was identified in the solution interviews as a crucial component: potential customers said they would be prepared to spend between 10 and 20 euros on an event that meets their demands and improves their experience in the rock community. This comment highlights the benefits we provide and draws attention to potential revenue streams for our platform. Equipped with this useful information, we can proceed with assurance, certain that our solution will strike a chord with our intended audience and have great potential to succeed in the market for rock enthusiasts. </p>

		<p>One of the questions we have encountered is: Why a website and not an app?. There are a lot of reasons to why we chose our product to be a website. First of all, a website is easily accessible for anyone who has a browser on their device. Everyone and anyone can just open Google and find us. Furthermore, our website is designed to be mobile-friendly. This makes it multifunctional since whether customers are using it from a laptop, tablet, or their phone device the customer experience doesn’t change. Moreover, developing a website is more cost-effective. This helps us to cut off expenses, which is important factor for any start up business. Finally, a website gives more benefits for small businesses as it offers more flexibility, branding, and credibility.  

All in all, we chose a website because for this step of the brand development it is not only cheaper but also more effective in helping us present our product to the target customers. </p>	  
          </ul>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>Before we conducted the problem interviews, we drew a lot of our assumptions from internet forums and discussions where fans of hard rock and rock voiced passionate views.  The importance of community and music within the rock scene was highlighted by these online communities, which offered insightful information on the tastes and priorities of rock fans. We developed initial assumptions based on these results, emphasising the value of community involvement, social interaction, and event discovery for rock fans. By speaking with people in the rock world, we were able to confirm and improve these assumptions as we moved through the problem interviews. We were able to check if our initial assumptions about the unique issues and pain points faced by rock fans were in line with their needs and wants through in-depth interviews and feedback sessions. These insights helped us discover that while the community has some of the problems we assumed (Struggling to find events, Hard to connect with other hard rock enthusiasts), it also helped us realise some of the solutions we assumed could help them, like a database of bands, albums and songs for discovery, would not solve the problems rock fans are actually facing. This led us to come up with better possible solutions, which then were validated through the solution interviews, which were an important source of confirmation for the assumptions we made in the last phase of the process. Our assumptions were on the value of a social aspect that would allow fans to interact, exchange stories, and talk about their favourite bands in addition to informing the community about nearby rock events.  We were able to verify that these solutions struck a deep chord with our target audience through the solution interviews. These verified assumptions then moved naturally into our Lean Canvas's final version. One of the biggest pivots we have faced based on all the insights we got throughout the different phases of the project was the decision that rather than just informing the rock community about nearby events, it would be more beneficial if we created our own events as it would create stronger connections within the community, while it would also improve our profits. Our solution grew to include features like informing users to local rock events that we host and organise, connecting rock lovers through a community and event chat, and allowing friends to be added to the system to create a buddy system for events and concerts.  As confirmed by direct input from our target audience, this connection between our initial assumptions, validated solutions, and final product version shows our dedication to satisfying the real requirements and wishes of rock fans. </p>
<p>In our research of existing alternatives, we have discovered that Discord and Facebook groups would clasify for that. Although these platforms provide a means of connection, our problem interviews have shown that they are lacking features specifically designed to meet the needs of rock fans. These alternatives don't offer enough ways of managing events and exchanging specialised content among the rock community. </p>
